TU Menu App

This code uses Swift's tableView feature and a bundled text file to read and display the Trinity University Breakfast Menu for the week. An initial tableView displays the days of the week, and upon selecting one, the user is directed to a new tableView which is populated by the menu information for that day, separated by menu section.
This app is written in Swift 4. Functionality has not (yet)  been added to update the menu for different weeks or other meals. Feel free to take a look at the code!

Also, I should note that the functionality for reading in the menu text file was written by Chris Reid.
